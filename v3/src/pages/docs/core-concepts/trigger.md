A trigger is an activity that can kick-off a workflow automatically.

Examples of triggers include:

- A timer that triggers a workflow every 5 minutes.
- A webhook that triggers a workflow when a HTTP request is received.
- A message queue that triggers a workflow when a message is received.

Triggers are typically used to start workflows in response to some external event, such as a HTTP request or a message from a message queue.
