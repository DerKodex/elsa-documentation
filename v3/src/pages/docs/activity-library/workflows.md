Workflow activities are workflows that can be used as an activity.
To use a workflow as activity in the settings "Usable As Activity" needs to be put on 'yes'.

In the Input/Output tab of the workflow you can specify input and output variables.

To set the value of an output variable you need to use the 'Set Workflow Output' activity under the Composition activities.
