description: A list of known issues and limitations.
---

Elsa is continually evolving, and while it offers powerful capabilities, there are some known limitations and ongoing work:

- Documentation is still a work in progress.
- The designer is not yet fully embeddable in other applications; this feature is planned for a future release.
- C# and Python expressions are not yet fully tested.
- Bulk Dispatch Workflows is a new activity and not yet fully tested.
- Input/Output is not yet implemented in the Workflow Instance Viewer.
- Starting workflows from the designer is currently supported only for workflows that do not require input and do not start with a trigger; this is planned for a future release.
- The designer currently only supports Flowchart activities. Support for Sequence and StateMachine activities is planned for a future release.
- UI input validation is not yet implemented.
