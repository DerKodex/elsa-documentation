### Dive into Elsa's Programmatic API

Elsa Workflows offers a programmatic API that draws inspiration from the Windows Workflows Foundation 4. This API provides developers with a powerful toolset to define workflows with precision and flexibility.

#### **Sequential Workflows**

Sequential workflows allow you to define a series of activities that execute in a specific order. Here's a simple example that prompts the user for their name and then displays it:

```clike
// Define a workflow variable to capture the output of the ReadLine activity.
var nameVariable = new Variable<string>();

// Define a simple sequential workflow:
var workflow = new Sequence
{
    // Register the name variable.
    Variables = { nameVariable }, 
    
    // Setup the sequence of activities to run.
    Activities =
    {
        new WriteLine("Please tell me your name:"), 
        new ReadLine(nameVariable),
        new WriteLine(context => $"Nice to meet you, {nameVariable.Get(context)}!")
    }
};
```

#### Flowchart Workflows

For more complex workflows, Elsa supports `Flowchart` activities. 
These allow you to define workflows as a graph of interconnected activities, offering greater flexibility:

```clike
public class BraidedWorkflow : WorkflowBase
{
    protected override void Build(IWorkflowBuilder workflow)
    {
        var writeLine1 = new WriteLine("WriteLine1");
        var writeLine2 = new WriteLine("WriteLine2");
        var writeLine3 = new WriteLine("WriteLine3");
        var writeLine4 = new WriteLine("WriteLine4");
        var writeLine5 = new WriteLine("WriteLine5");
        var writeLine6 = new WriteLine("WriteLine6");
        var writeLine7 = new WriteLine("WriteLine7");

        workflow.Root = new Flowchart
        {
            Start = writeLine1,
            
            Activities =
            {
                writeLine1,
                writeLine2,
                writeLine3,
                writeLine4,
                writeLine5,
                writeLine6,
                writeLine7,
            },

            Connections =
            {
                new Connection(writeLine1, writeLine2),
                new Connection(writeLine1, writeLine3),

                new Connection(writeLine2, writeLine4),
                new Connection(writeLine2, writeLine5),

                new Connection(writeLine3, writeLine5),
                new Connection(writeLine3, writeLine6),

                new Connection(writeLine4, writeLine7),
                new Connection(writeLine5, writeLine7),
                new Connection(writeLine6, writeLine7),
            }
        };
    }
}
```

When visualized, the flowchart workflow appears as:

## What's New

Elsa 3 represents a monumental leap from its predecessor, Elsa 2. This version is not just an upgrade; it's a complete rewrite, bringing forth a plethora of improvements, new features, and architectural changes. Here's a comprehensive overview of what Elsa 3 brings to the table:

### **Core Enhancements**

- **.NET 6 Targeting**: Elsa 3 is designed for the future, targeting .NET 6 and beyond.
  
- **Architectural Clarity**: A clear distinction has been made between the core library, the management library, and the runtime library. This separation ensures enhanced flexibility and integration capabilities.
  
- **Reduced Dependencies**: With fewer dependencies, integrating Elsa into your existing applications is now more seamless than ever.

### **Designer & Programming Model**

- **Revamped Visual Designer**: Experience a state-of-the-art designer equipped with features like drag & drop, multi-select, undo, redo, copy & paste, and more.
  
- **Innovative Programming Model**: Crafting workflows from code and developing custom activities have never been easier, thanks to the new programming model.

- **Diverse Diagram Support**: Beyond the traditional Flowchart and Sequence diagrams, Elsa 3 paves the way for future support for State Machine and BPMN 2.0 diagrams.

### **Execution & Runtime**

- **Queue-Based Scheduler**: Elsa 3 adopts a queue-based workflow scheduler, transitioning from the stack-based approach of previous versions. This change promotes breadth-first execution.
  
- **Parallel Activity Execution**: Activities can now run concurrently using the `Task` and `Job` activity kinds.
  
- **Versatile Workflow Runtimes**: While the default runtime is database-based, Elsa 3 introduces support for a distributed runtime using Proto.Actor, enabling lock-free workflow execution across multiple nodes.

- **Middleware Pipeline**: A middleware pipeline architecture has been implemented for both workflow and activity execution.

### **C# Expressions**

- **C# Expressions**: Elsa 3 introduces support for C# expressions, allowing you to evaluate values dynamically during runtime.

### **Persistence & Security**

- **Flexible Persistence**: The simplified persistence abstraction in Elsa 3 allows you to choose from a range of persistence technologies. Whether it's SQL Server, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch, Elsa 3 has got you covered.
  
- **Secured API Endpoints**: By default, API endpoints are now secured. You have the flexibility to configure authentication using JWT tokens, API keys, or even opt for no authentication.

- **Non-Persistent Activity Data**: Activity input & output are non-persistent by default, ensuring data security. However, if persistence is required, workflow variables can be used to capture and store the data.

### **Workflow Context**

- **Enhanced Workflow Context**: Elsa 3 introduces versatile Workflow Context support, allowing the configuration of multiple workflow context providers for each workflow.

## Features

Elsa Workflows is a robust platform designed to simplify the creation and management of workflow-driven applications. Here's a comprehensive overview of its feature set:

### **Workflow Creation**

- **Programmatic Workflows**: Craft workflows programmatically using code. This approach offers strong typing and the ability to reuse workflows across different scenarios.

- **Visual Designer**: Use Elsa's intuitive visual designer to create workflows. This graphical approach is perfect for those who prefer a visual representation and offers the same reusability benefits.

### **Workflow Execution Types**

- **Short-Running Workflows**: These workflows execute seamlessly from start to finish without any suspension. They're ideal for tasks like sending emails or executing a series of steps.

- **Long-Running Workflows**: Designed for tasks that require suspension and resumption. Examples include workflows that await external events or those that orchestrate lengthy tasks.

### **Activity Management**

- **Composite Activities**: Activities like `Sequence` and `Flowchart` that can encapsulate other activities. You can design your own composite activities either programmatically or using the visual designer. These can be reused across different workflows.

- **Triggers**: Activities designed to initiate a workflow. Examples include `HttpEndpoint` and `Timer`.

- **Activities**: The fundamental building blocks of workflows. Elsa comes with a rich set of activities like `WriteLine`, `SendEmail`, `HttpRequest`, and more. The platform's extensibility allows you to add custom activities as needed.

- **Activity Providers**: These providers supply activity types to Elsa. For instance, `TypedActivityProvider` offers activity types based on `IActivity` implementations. Elsa's flexibility will soon support activity types from GraphQL, OpenAPI, JavaScript functions, and more.

### **Dynamic Expressions**

- **Expressions**: Dynamically evaluate values during runtime. Elsa natively supports JavaScript and Liquid expressions, but it's designed to accommodate custom expression evaluators.

    - **C# Example**:
      ```clike
      $"The current date and time is: {DateTime.Now}"
      ```

    - **JavaScript Example**:
      ```javascript
      `The current date and time is: ${new Date()}`
      ```

    - **Liquid Example**:
      ```liquid
      The current date and time is: {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" }}
      ```

### **Persistence & Hosting**

- **Persistence**: Elsa allows workflows to be saved to a database, enabling their resumption even after application restarts. The persistence mechanism is abstract, allowing for custom persistence providers.

- **Workflow Hosting**: Integrate and execute workflows directly within your application, offering a seamless user experience.

### **Integration Capabilities**

- **External Application Integration**: Elsa workflows can be triggered from any external application capable of making HTTP requests. Conversely, Elsa workflows can interact with external applications through HTTP requests, webhooks, service bus messages, gRPC, and more.
